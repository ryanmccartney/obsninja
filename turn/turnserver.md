## Install and setup gudie for a TURN Relay Server

#### why? You may want to deploy one to ensure high compatiblity with remote guests. If you try to use the official OBS.Ninja TURN servers for a private deployment, you may find yourself getting kicked off.

This install script and config file was used with a standard virtual machine server loaded with Ubuntu 20.  GCP/AWS servers might need slightly different settings.

```
sudo apt-get update # update package lists
 
sudo apt-get install coturn -y # install coturn, the implementation of the TURN server
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot # Add the certbot repository
sudo apt-get install certbot -y # Install certbot required for the HTTPS certificate

sudo vi /etc/default/coturn # open the coturn configuration in Vim (you can also use nano or any other editor)
```
...and we uncomment the line:
```
#TURNSERVER_ENABLED=1
```
â€¦.leaving it like this:
```
TURNSERVER_ENABLED=1
```
Next make sure you have the DNS pointing to your IP address for this next step (ipv4, and ipv6 if possible). You will need to validate that in the next step.
```
sudo certbot certonly --standalone # only generate the HTTPS certificate without actually changing any configs
sudo apt install net-tools
```
note: If you run into error 701 issues with your TURN server, check that the coturn service has access to your new SSL certificates:
see this issue with coturn: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/268

You might also want to consider buying a better certificiate, as not all Google-related projects properly support certbot certificates, including libwebrtc. see [this issue ticket](https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/240#issuecomment-648550885).  If you go this route, see [turnserver2.conf](https://github.com/steveseguin/obsninja/blob/master/turnserver2.conf) for an example config.

Next, we may want to update the User and Group values in our service file to be "root". This seems to be a quick hacky fix for the issue with Lets Encrypt. ..  I welcome a better solution tho.  If you move the certs somewhere else, or buy proper certificates, then the default turnserver user/group will work.

```
sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/coturn.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Next, we are going to open up some ports... just in case they are blocked by default. Which exactly? well, these are default ports. TCP may not be needed?
```
sudo ufw allow 3478/tcp # The default coturn TCP port
sudo ufw allow 3478/udp # The default coturn UDP port
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp # The HTTPS TCP port
sudo ufw allow 443/udp # The HTTPS UDP port
sudo ufw allow 49152:65535/tcp
sudo ufw allow 49152:65535/udp
```

If we expect heavy usage of this server, like hundreds of connections, you might want to ensure your system supports enough open sockets. I'm not sure if this actually works or is needed, but you can see this article for example on how to increase the number of available sockets on Ubuntu: https://medium.com/@muhammadtriwibowo/set-permanently-ulimit-n-open-files-in-ubuntu-4d61064429a  


Next, update turnserver.conf with passwords, domain names, and whatever else that needs changing.  Example contents are provided below.  Once you have updated it, start the TURN server and ensure it started correctly. 
```
sudo vi /etc/turnserver.conf

sudo systemctl restart coturn
sudo systemctl status coturn
sudo systemctl enable coturn
```

The following are the contents of an example /etc/turnserver.conf file from above
```
## sudo vi /etc/turnserver.conf

listening-port=3478
## TLS needs an SSL certificate and domain, but enables TCP
tls-listening-port=443

# min-port=49152
# max-port=65535

realm=turn.obs.ninja
server-name=turn.obs.ninja

## webrtc likes to use this
fingerprint

## Lets just use Google since its more reliable
no-stun

lt-cred-mech
user=SOMESUERNAME:SOMEPASSWQORD

stale-nonce=600

## depreciated in newer coturn
# no-loopback-peers

## prevents hackers from hacking
no-multicast-peers

## 1-gbps/100 users = ~ 1-mbps each with this setting then
total-quota=100

cert=/etc/letsencrypt/live/turn.obs.ninja/fullchain.pem
pkey=/etc/letsencrypt/live/turn.obs.ninja/privkey.pem

## Tweaks to fix some lets encrypt errors
cipher-list="ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA512:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384"
no-sslv3
no-tlsv1
no-tlsv1_1
# no-tlsv1_2
dh2066

# no-udp
# no-tcp

# verbose
no-stdout-log

## optional
proc-user=root
proc-group=root

```

Setting this all up is easier said then done. good luck!
